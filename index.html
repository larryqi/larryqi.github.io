  Hi, my name is Lin Qi ,and I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with a Master’s degree of Engineering in 2018. My current location is Shanghai, in China.  On the web and with friends, I am also known as "larryqi", which has been my nickname since a long time ago.  You should probably also know that I do not have a sleep schedule, which means that I am usually awake whenever there is work to do.

  Original address: A Gentle Guide to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subfield within Artificial Intelligence that builds algorithms that allow computers to learn to perform tasks from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
Got it? We can make machines learn to do things! The first time I heard that, it blew my mind. That means that we can program computers to learn things by themselves!
