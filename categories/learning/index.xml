Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) A field of study with the goal of creating machines that exhibit intelligence.
Machine Learning (ML) A sub-field of AI, whose focus is to use data to train computer algorithms to perform tasks that typically cannot be done (or very difficult to accomplish) through hard wiring the logic into a program, because no one is quite sure what the rules are. Recognizing objects in images is one such task where the rules are unclear.</description>

      <description>Original address: A Gentle Guide to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subfield within Artificial Intelligence that builds algorithms that allow computers to learn to perform tasks from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
Got it? We can make machines learn to do things! The first time I heard that, it blew my mind. That means that we can program computers to learn things by themselves!
The ability of learning is one of the most important aspects of intelligence.</description>
